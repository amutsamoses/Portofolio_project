# WebAppProject

This project aims to create a web application that facilitates real-time chat functionality. It covers various aspects of web development including backend server setup, handling HTTP requests, user authentication, and database management.

## Learning Objectives Achieved:

1. **Backend Development**: The project implements a backend server using Python's `socketserver` module to handle HTTP requests and responses.

2. **User Authentication**: User authentication is implemented using username-password authentication with salted hashing. This ensures secure authentication of users.

3. **Database Management**: MongoDB is used as the database for storing user data, chat messages, and authentication tokens. The `pymongo` library is used to interact with the MongoDB database.

4. **Real-time Communication**: The web application supports real-time chat functionality where users can send and receive messages instantly without the need to refresh the page.

## Installation Instructions:

### Prerequisites:

- Docker installed on your system.

### Steps to Install:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd WebAppProject
   ```

3. **Build Docker Containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

4. **Start Docker Containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. **Access the Web Application**:

   Once the containers are up and running, you can access the web application by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## Project Structure:

- `server.py`: Contains the main server logic implemented using Python's `socketserver` module.
- `util`: Directory containing utility modules for request handling, authentication, routing, etc.
- `public`: Directory containing static assets such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the frontend.

## Usage:

- **Register/Login**: Users can register for a new account or log in using existing credentials.
- **Real-time Chat**: Users can send and receive messages in real-time with other logged-in users.
- **Logout**: Users can log out of their accounts to end their session securely.
